<p style="color:rgb(8, 8, 8);font-size:25px;">Red Fox Facts
Foxes can jump high fences and swim well.
There are 3 color morphs of foxes, but the most typical is red.
A fox uses its tail, also known as a “brush,” as a cover in the winter when laying down.
Red foxes are omnivores.
Fox predators include coyotes, bald eagles, gray wolves, bears, mountain lions, and humans.
A fox can live up to 10-12 years in captivity, but only about 3 years in the wild.
Foxes make scent posts with urine or feces to mark their territory.
Foxes can make 12 different vocal sounds. Kits can produce 8 sounds.
Red Foxes are nocturnal.
Red Fox pounce on their prey to catch it.
Foxes have excellent senses. They can hear an animal underground!
Foxes constantly hunt for food. Even if they are not hungry, they will save it for their next meal.
Red Fox Habitat
Red foxes live in a wide range in the Northern Hemisphere. They live in grasslands, deserts, 
mountains, forests, and even suburban areas. They adapt very well to different environments, but prefer wooded areas the most. When it is breeding season, foxes will build dens and stay in them. When it is not breeding season, foxes sleep in the open.
What Do Foxes Eat?
Foxes are omnivores who hunt mainly small rodents, birds and rabbits. However, they will occasionally eat vegetables, fruit, mice, and fish.</p>
<p style="color:rgb(12, 12, 12);font-size:25px;"> Physical Description
  Coloration of red foxes ranges from pale yellowish red to deep reddish brown on the upper parts and white, ashy or slaty on the underside.
   The lower part of the legs is usually black and the tail usually has a white or black tip. Two color variants commonly occur. Cross foxes have reddish brown fur with a black stripe down the back and another across the shoulders. Silver foxes range from strong silver to nearly black and are the most prized by furriers. These variants are about 25% and 10% of red fox individuals, respectively. Red foxes, like many other canid species, have tail glands. In Vulpes vulpes this gland is located 75 mm above the root of the tail on its upper surface and lies within the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. The eyes of mature animals are yellow. The nose is dark brown or black. The dental formula is 3/3 1/1 4/4 2/3. The tooth row is more than half the length of the skull. The premolars are simple and pointed, with the exception of upper fourth premolars, the carnassials. Molar structure emphasizes crushing. The manus has 5 claws and the pes 4 claws. The first digit, or dew claw, is rudimentary but clawed 
   and does not contact the ground.
  Red foxes are the largest of the Vulpes species. Head and body length ranges from 455 to 900 mm, tail length from 300 to 555 mm, and weight from 3 to 14 kg. Males are slightly larger than females. Populations in southern deserts and in North America are smaller than European populations. Body mass and length among populations also varies with latitude (being larger in the north, according to Bergmann's rule).

   <p style="color:rgb(12, 12, 12);font-size:25px;">   
    Red fox mating behavior varies substantially. 
    Often males and females are monogamous, but males with
    multiple female mates are also know, as are male/female pairs that
    use non-breeding female helpers in raising their young. Females mated to the same male fox may share a den. Red fox groups always have only one breeding male, but that male may also seek 
    mating outside of the group.
    The annual estrous period of female red foxes last from 1 to 6 days. Ovulation is spontaneous and does not require copulation to occur. The exact time of estrous and breeding varies across the broad geographic range of the species: December-January in the south, January-February in the central regions, and February-April in the north. Males will fight during the breeding season. Males have a cycle of fecundity, with full spermatogenesis only occurring from November to March. Females may mate with a number of males but will establish a partnership with only one male. Copulation usually lasts 15 or 20 minutes and is often accompanied by a vocal clamor. Implantation of the fertilized egg occurs between 10 and 14 days after a successful mating. Just before and for a time after giving birth the female remains in or around the den. The male partner will provision his mate with food but does not go into the maternity den. Gestation is typically between 51 and 53 days but can be as short as 49 days or as long as 56 days. Litters vary in size from 1 to 13 pups with an average of 5. Birth weight is between 50 and 150 g. The pups are born blind but open their eyes 9 to 14 days after birth. Pups leave the den 4 or 5 weeks after birth and are fully weaned by 8 to 10 weeks. Mother and pups remain together until 
    the autumn after the birth. Sexual maturity is reached by 10 months.
